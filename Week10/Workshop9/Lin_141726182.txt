This week’s workshop is about threads. 
I learned that threads are related to scheduling, but I still can’t get familiar with it. 
For task2, I don't have too many problems. On the contrary, task1 gave me a lot of problems... 
I think I did not complete task1... 
For example, parallelMultiplyMatrix() should run the multiple threads, but I didn't use it at all...
